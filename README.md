# CUDA Unix

Welcome to CUDA Unix, an fully-fledged Unix operating system that runs on the GPU. (Yes, you read that correctly)

## Project Overview

CUDA Unix is an esoteric project that aims to port the beloved Unix operating system (xv6) to run exclusively on CUDA-enabled devices. By harnessing the parallel processing capabilities of CUDA, we're taking Unix to a whole new level! Tested on a GTX 1060, CUDA compute capability 6.1.

## Features

- Absolute exploitation of CUDA's supposed turing completeness
- Lightning-fast parallel processing for all your Unix tasks.
- Embrace the power of CUDA with familiar Unix commands.
- Experience the joy of debugging Unix on a GPU.

## Getting Started

To get started with CUDA Unix, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/cuda-unix.git`
2. Install the necessary CUDA toolkit and drivers.
3. Build the CUDA Unix kernel: `make cuda-kernel`
4. Launch CUDA Unix: `./cuda-unix`

Please note that CUDA Unix is an experimental project and should not be used in production environments. I don't even know how that would be possible, to be honest. Use at your own risk!
